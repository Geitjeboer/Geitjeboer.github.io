        <p>A data scientist with over a decade of experience in healthcare, I gather data using statistical models to help improve patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>I have worked in healthcare for over a decade running analytical testing. This involves running quality assurance, creating patient testing parameters, and communicating with stake holders about medical test results.</p>

        <p>I also have over a decade of teaching experience. This includes a masters in secondary education, training fellow healthcare workers, and teaching students from preschool to post graduate levels. Being able to communicate and learn as a team is a very important skill in education and all fields of work.</p>

        <p>As a data scientist I am excited to analyze data to improve the systems around us.</p>
